# Pet-Clinic-Kafkaesque
An attempt to split [Pet-Clinic-Backend](https://github.com/m-saz/pet-clinic-backend) project into microservices with *barbaric* usage of Apache Kafka to implement synchronous Request-Reply communication.

**Work in progress.**

Run with `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`

You need to run [Frontend App](https://github.com/m-saz/pet-clinic-frontend) to gain access

NOTE: All services use the same database for the sake of simplicity
